# RedM Native/Game Types

This package contains "easy-to-use" types for RedM.

For example:
```js
import * as game from '@risinglife/redm-natives';

game.scripts.shutdownLoadingScreen();
```

### Since v0.0.11 (and higher)
All root methods are now deprecated and refer directly to the “namespace typings”.
What the namespaces are can be read directly, as the correct method is stored as a “deprecation” message.

In order to provide downward compatibility, the root methods will remain available until v1, as a complete rewrite is expected in v1.

### Information
